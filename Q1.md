Create a function that processes sales data provided as a CSV-formatted string. The function should parse the data and compute the total sales, the average sale amount, and aggregate sales by both region and product. The results should be returned in a structured dictionary format.

Input Format: The input csv_data is a string representing CSV data with the following columns: region, product, and amount.

Output: 
The function should return a dictionary with the following structure:

total_sales: The sum of all sales amounts as a float.</br>
avg_sale: The average sale amount as a float.</br>
sales_by_region: A dictionary mapping each region to its total sales amount.</br>
sales_by_product: A dictionary mapping each product to its total sales amount.</br>

Assumptions:
The CSV data is well-formed and does not contain missing or invalid values.
The amount field contains numeric values.
